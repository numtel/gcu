<h1>Unconquering the World</h1>
<article>
<blockquote>
We are not isolated by distance
But by greed and our racist history
Just a wall's width away
Still impossible to see across
This space in front on me

It's we who write this history
We who guard the money tree
We support the companies
We stole the colonies

And when the system starts to crack
We'll have to be ready to give it all back

Hop on a plane and fly anywhere,
the furthest place is a day away.
Pick up your phone,
the connection is instant.

It wasn't very long ago that communicating vast distances took significant time.
Like sugar's 


How could it be done?

I don't think anybody knows for sure.

Stop commercial activity between settlements?

Obviously not at once, or suddenly, but with planned execution,
we would make every town/city self-sufficient.

This lets each settlement define cultural characteristics.
We already allow this though?

Not extended to banking and currencies, but this is now something explorable with cryptocurrency.

Why would we want it?
How else are we going to get a world where few people work more than 20 hours per week?
We want the world to be something wild and benign.

Is this parody or satire?
What isn't?
