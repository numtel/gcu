<h1>Clean water anywhere, and for everybody</h1>
<article>
The planet's water sources are no longer clean. While rumors of graphene-based water filtering and desalination have been around for decades, metal-organic frameworks, or MOFs, are emerging as an even more attractive solution to thirst: a novel molecular structure to passively collect water anywhere, directly from the atmosphere.

<a href="http://wahainc.com/">Water Harvesting Inc.</a> is developing an MOF that can do this at a rate of multiple liters/per day per kilogram of material.

Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPSYzLZ7xKU">a report from the channel Seeker on YouTube about this development</a>.

This is a fundamental game-changing technology to our conception of space within earth's atmosphere. We will be able to live anywhere without having to build infrastructure to bring clean water.
