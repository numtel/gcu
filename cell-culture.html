<h1>Cell cultures free us from the constraint of the field</h1>
<article>
Depending on your political views, we've either been coerced or have agreed to crowdfunding societies by lords and governments for the past 10,000 years.

All, because agriculture's toil begs for schemes of efficiency.

Therefore, large scales organize us to share the load.

But if we could eat an easier way, all that would be irrelevant.

Agriculture is celebrated, guiding our calendar and festivals because we're hungry, not because we think intensively-cultivated fields are better than forests. Maintaining and expanding the population of humans on this planet may require a new route towards producing food.

Like high-tech yogurt, growing cell cultures that provide complete nutrition with very little inputs will decentralize food production, as 3D printing does for manufacturing.

Global trade and the placement of business at the top of our values, only exists because it is, currently, the source of our sustenance.

For this reason, expect the agricultural lobby to apply all possible misinformation techniques against it.

Cell culture reactor appliances could develop to the level of ubiquity that smartphones have in the last decade, revolutionizing humanity's use of the planet's land in a similar amount of time.

Agriculture's control of the land is our biggest driver of natural resource destruction as well as the greatest limiting factor on human population growth.

Researchers at <a href="https://solarfoods.fi/">Solar Foods</a> in Finland are already on track to commercialize this technology in the next year.

A society fed by cell cultures growing in each home would require much less labor and energy to meet basic human needs. By welcoming individual cells as food, we'll get the best parts of the foods we have today, faster and easier than growing entire plants or animals. Lab-grown meat has already gathered much press.

Solar Foods says their product can be used as source nutrition for growing meat cultures but <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/future-will-we-be-growing-fruit-home-bioreactors-180968133/">their previous research growing fruit cells in a home bioreactor</a> opens my mind to mixtures of cultures that satisfy taste buds in ways we can only dream today.

No longer will we have to fear a season's poor yield. Cultural growth cycles will be quick and protected within the appliance.

The need for vast lands will be eliminated. This is how we return farms to wildlife.

The thirst for fresh water will be satisfied by a trickle. According to the World Bank, <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water-in-agriculture">"Agriculture accounts for, on average, 70 percent of all water withdrawals globally"</a> but cultures grown in this way use only a small fraction of the water and land.

From <a href="https://solarfoods.fi/blog/solar-foods-confronts-the-climate-crisis/">a recent Solar Foods blog post</a>:
<blockquote>When we consider the land that could be preserved if protein production from conventional farming was transitioned to Solein, our productâ€™s already minimal CO2 footprint turns into a way to carbon sink.</blockquote>

When feeding oneself can be done completely by an "at-home, cell culture reactor appliance" and a solar panel, each person will be free to live a much simpler life.
