A recent report from Vice, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hhzrormtP4">Geoengineering may be the answer to climate change</a>, surveys a selection of projects attempting to mitigate the effects of climate change by modifying the atmosphere.

This selection of projects ignores solutions that would radically alter our economy.

Species are going extinct at a tremendous rate due to loss of habitat.
We may become one of these species too.

Our large-scale agricultural systems are very fragile.

The planet's waters and skies are increasingly polluted.

As Naomi Klein describes in her book, <u>The Shock Doctrine</u>,
instability benefits the vultures.

We've got a huge population that we want to keep fed, and alive.

We've also got an understanding of biology at an amazingly-advanced level.

In a new research press release, <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/a-new-tomato-ideal-for-urban-gardens-and-even-outer-space/">A new tomato ideal for urban gardens and even outer space</a>, another direction for our economy can be imagined.

There's also the possibility of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51019798">synthesizing food from the air directly</a>.

Combined with passive atmospheric water harvesting touted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPSYzLZ7xKU">this report from Seeker on YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/09/crystalline-nets-harvest-water-desert-air-turn-carbon-dioxide-liquid-fuel">"Crystalline nets harvest water from desert air, turn carbon dioxide into liquid fuel" from ScienceMag</a>, a return a "Garden of Eden" becomes plausible. (<a href="http://wahainc.com">Now being commercialized</a>)

Growing the food and getting it to us is a huge amount of work in our current economy.

The introduction of agriculture is associated with shorter stature and worse nutrition than previous generations that subsisted on wild harvesting.

The all-or-nothing toil in the fields associated with farming has established a destructive work-ethic in our culture.

But with greater distribution of clean water and extremely fecund plants, we could have enough food for us and all the other species of animals, without having to explicitly manage fields.

Agriculture was adopted because the old world dried up, not by choice.

We now have the technology to attempt to return the planet to the abundant forests that we dream about.

It is our mission to abandon high-speed, long-distance networks of communication and transportation in favor of localized groups that live within a convivial world.

As Gabriel Garcia Marquez elucidates in <u>One Hundred Years of Solitude</u>, instant communication and rapid transit enable centralized control, stamping out diversity and beauty.

Like Terrence McKenna's <u>Archaic Revival</u>, we look backward to create a better future.

When the world is localized, a few hours' walk to the next town will provide more novelty than a plane trip between today's megacities.

Globalization has transformed every culture to be centered around business.
We've lost our diversity in the market's commodification.

The protesters in Paris May 1968 exclaimed, "sous les pavés, la plage" (beneath the pavement, the beach)

We proclaim, "beneath the pavement, the forest!"

Tear up the streets, made for polluting cars, and give a habitat back to all species!

This is a condemnation of global material goods trade.
This is a celebration of global movement of information and people.
