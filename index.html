<h3>Introduction</h3>
Politics can be defined as friction at boundaries.
A boundary is a line that separates inside from outside: me/us from you/them.
Every observation sets boundaries, delineating open space.
Friction is the negotiation between adjacent surfaces.

Zero friction is a deterministic prison where oberservation never makes a difference.
Nobody's happy with giving up our strong intuition of free will.
We demand processes for addressing our issues.

The duality inherent in everything: is and is not, simultaneously.
An entity, that claims to be one thing, is, almost always, also the opposite.

Elections seek mandates for Democracy,
and government institutions purport to reflect voter values,
but conflicting interests make this impossible.

Modernity followed Colonial expansion, vulgarly declaring,
"We're conquering the world!"

With Godel's revelation that knowledge is forever incomplete,
Einstein's theorem that time is unique to each subject,
and the environmental disaster caused by our industry,
a new sentiment observes, "conquering the world was a mistake."

This is what Post-Modernity looks like.
