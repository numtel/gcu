<h1>Seeing Earth's Opening</h1>

Prerequisite: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/lab-grown-food-destroy-farming-save-planet">"Lab-grown food will soon destroy farming – and save the planet" by George Monbiot</a>

<details><summary>We don’t have to organize to feed ourselves more efficiently anymore.</summary>

From kingdoms with feudal lords to states with government oversight, humanity progressively reduces the agricultural burden on each individual. The climate is such that we must work to eat but we are smart enough to figure out ways to do this with increasingly less work.

With a full nutritional profile available from fast-growing engineered cultures, each individual can carry their own food source. This makes our organizational efficiency obsolete. Any remaining organization is purely optional.

<details><summary>With our basic needs of food and water met by our alchemical clothing, we are free to roam wildly, without further development.</summary>

Imagine a multi-layered jacket: outside surface flanked with MOF atmospheric water harvesting material, inside surface lined with nutritional culture pouches regulated by the body’s temperature. We no longer need to go to the grocery store, the water tap, or the office. We’re all fully housed without needing walls.

<details><summary>The end of useful technology has arrived. All further ideas are just toying around: AI, space travel, just wishing for utility.</summary>

This trumping of our established patterns of work will be of great surprise to many specialists but the fundamental realization is that our animal bodies have no use for wasted time. We can just be and that is enough. Growth is back to being for children and adult life, for enjoyment.

</details>
<details><summary>Our legs are enough because everything is right here. We can take a break, for months if we want. There’s no reason to stress or worry.</summary>

Sit down under this tree. It’s quite nice in its shade. We’re warm enough and have plenty of supplies, let’s stay a while. That was a nice nap. How long has it been? No bother. Did you see the beautiful fox pass?

</details>
<details><summary>The eroding edifices still standing can’t fall soon enough but I won’t hasten their disappearance. I’m more concerned with dancing.</summary>

All this crap we’ve built will be covered over soon enough. There’s no reason to feed destructive tendencies. We can have the best time right here anyways with a graceful swing of the hips and shake of the arms.
