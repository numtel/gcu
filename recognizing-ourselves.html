<h1>Recognizing Ourselves</h1>
<article>
Everybody arrives with their own story,
sometimes pointed down a difficult road,
but always possible to turn around,
until the last adaption,
hopefully never arriving

Responding to Manu Chao,
"¿Cuando llegaré?" (When will I arrive?)
"Ojala, jamas" (hopefully, never)

Everything bad happens,
but everything good does as well.

&mdash;

The key point of the manifestation of mind
is that mind is not a property of the physical body,
it's <em>the</em> fundamental quality of the universe.

Symbolic relations generate space between possible extremes,
existing beyond condensed forms,
as proudly in-formation.

Therefore, act like physical borders don't exist
because they are only symptoms of
that still in-formation.

Every angle you see
comes from entities
too shy to say hi
but directing from the periphery.

I misspoke:
you are them
and they are you,
there is no boundary.

English is my second language,
glossolalia is my first,
and yours too.
