<h1>Recognizing Ourselves</h1>
<article>
I can't do a better job explaining than the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unchained-Woman-Bike-Dream-World-ebook/dp/B081XCNNWC">Unchained</a>. (Not an affiliate URL and acknowledging the pains to link to Bozo's site but hegemonds are what they are)

Unchained dissolves boundaries by retelling the fast-unfolding story of a woman's travel through countless countries. At eye-level with every person she encounters, R.M. Soorty paints an image of the beauty that exists on this planet.

By going the places the rest of us are too afraid, as well as courageously divulging their dark sides, this story gives a revolutionary dose of hope for humanity, serving as model for all who meet adversity by strongly carrying the message of authenticity: be true to yourself.

Public displays of international connection and friendship like this are what we all need in the current climate of widespread distrust of others. As this text shows, an overwhelming majority of people are happy to help someone pursuing their dreams even though a few try to get in the way.

&mdash;

Psychedelics are described as mind-manifesting
but the key point is that mind is
not a property of the physical body,
it's the fundamental quality of the universe.

Symbolic relations generate space
between possible extremes,
while existing beyond condensed forms,
as proudly in-formation.

Therefore, act like physical borders don't exist
because they are only symptoms of
that still in-formation.

Every angle you see
comes from entities
too shy to say hi
but directing from the periphery.

I misspoke:
you are them
and they are you,
there is no boundary.
