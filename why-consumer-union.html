<h1>Why a Consumer Union</h1>
<article>
Well, we are consuming the planet, are we not?

The term, consumer, feels alien to my personal experience,
like something from an account book, not an actual human.

Consumption is the reverse side of labor.

What if there was an open-source implementation of Amazon, that was better?

We should recognize our collective buying power together,
without relying on merchant middlemen.

We should ask for what we want,
instead of just buying what's sold.

Empty platitudes,
until default is questioned.
