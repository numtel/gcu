<h1>The multi-tenant hypothesis of consciousness</h1>
<article>
Sorry, you have no control.
Also, you have full control.
It's <em>you</em> that you're not sure of.

Our stories are dealt to us
But are our "decisions" dealt as well?
Those moments where we feel an urge to speak up,
but continue along the plan as dictated,
forever wondering what else could have developed,
fade the light.

Stuck maintaining house,
my thoughts reflect on self-maintenence.

On a trip, the thoughts come as the days,
unplanned and free.

Making lists:
The order of life:
Birth, reproduction, death

I'm an entity, focused on this body's experience.
It's extremely attractive,
I can't see anything else,
and at the times when it feels like turning away,
recovery always arrives.

Do any other entities focus on this physical body,
as I do, of whom I am not yet aware?

In a physics where choices are aggregates of the past, my entity could be just watching this time go by, like a TV that can't be turned from

How would I communicate with other entities watching this experience?

Does a physical reproduction mandate a new emotional interest?

As someone yet to bear a child,
and not equipped with the necessary birth-giving anatomy,
I wonder if the greatest secret never told
(or always told because those like me would laugh that their mothers could watch their kids' experience, like a TV program, and, because mothers already claim to know exactly what their kids are up to)
is that a kernel of experience transfers during conception, forging a permanent link.

So, the story is that parents can live on through their offspring.

&mdash;

This fits into the multi-tenant hypothesis of consciousness: the brain produces a signal very attractive to spiritual entities. These signals broadcast in a spacetime barely-related to the one we know.

These entities get sucked into watching our experiences, like we do with a TV series. Because of this arrangement, there may be any number (zero to infinity) of entities paying attention, and guiding a body through novel subject introduction.

This fits with a deterministic, non-free-will brain hypothesis but introduces the will of the entities as the sum-total of absolutely-improbably-seeming experiences they arrange.

To test the hypothesis:
We ask for things in our broadcasts,
like the questions above but more specific,
so we can be more sure it's a response.

But that's impossible because that's the central rule:
The actions of the entities are always plausibly deniable
because a reasonable past is always made available:
If any digging is done, the entity's agency fades into an undeniable story.

Is the zero point of Terence McKenna's Timewave Zero model the point when
these hidden entities can no longer maintain their plausible deniability?
When it's impossible to stitch together those past stories without conflict?

Like the loudest stereo overpowering others,
the most attractive experiences obscure the others.

&mdash;

The multi-tenant hypothesis of consciousness
postulates that each living body
is like a bright light.

Like flies in the night,
observers cannot turn away from
the unfolding stories of these physically-constrained bodies.

The body's subjects only indirectly
receive information from these non-physical observers.

There could be hundreds of "people" seeing through your eyes right now.

Authenticity only
brightens the body's light,
attracting more observers,
who, in their blinded state,
do not notice each other.

"Look at this! Look at this! Look at this!"

Normally, these observers' set-ups are behind the veil of the physical senses
but under extremely still (non-moving) conditions,
the senses fade,
like something that goes unnoticed because it never changes,
and the observing entities are revealed.

As our bodies meet and intermingle,
entities shift their focus.

&mdash;

The generalization of ideas opens them to a range of interpretations.
The test for the multi-tenant hypothesis is somewhat like prayer:
By physically addressing the observers,
a bidirectional conversation can emerge.

Robert Monroe's trilogy of books on the subject of
out of body experiences and the hemi-sync tapes he developed
express the lifeform beyond the physical body
in a powerfully frightening manner.

How could this realization not frighten the default viewpoint of a single free-will making decisions in each living body?

When you realize that there's no machinery in the smallest, single-celled organisms to make decisions but they still act with all the grace we do, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbnbBWJtwsf0jLGUwX5Q3g">Hank Green narrates in the Journey to the Microcosmos Youtube channel</a>, or as <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31431-9">researchers study "A Complex Hierarchy of Avoidance Behaviors in a Single-Cell Eukaryote"</a> a doubt begins to loom over that default viewpoint.

We are familiar with physical observers: friends, family.
It's the recognition of the non-physical observers that will allow our light to grow.

I'm an entity
watching a body.
Too bad there doesn't seem to be a memory outside of it.
<em>That's</em> why all this is so attractive.
