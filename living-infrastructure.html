<h1>Living Infrastructure</h1>
<article>
All animals can be human
and all economic and social infrastructure could be human

Our fall into communing with the inanimate removes us from the light atmosphere of life.

Centering on personal values and relations,
we'll have to go vegan to be nice


Maybe our bodies' individual cells could teach us how to unite into a collective entity?

Acting in complete unison,
living and dying in unflinching service,
each cell points to the whole for direction,
but maintains its own internal order.

As Terence McKenna describes in a lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf4LSFeQiZE">Gnosticism and Early Christianity</a>:
let's reject the thrust of Western religion:

<blockquote>
We don't belong here
We are strangers
Something terrible happened
and that's why we're here.
</blockquote>

This is not helpful to our situation
We must learn to be long
(in time)

&mdash;

Goods hand-off:
human chain distribution

Not just <a href="https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10933-what_the_world_can_learn_from_hongkong">for protest</a>,
this maximally efficient
tool could be implemented
for everything.

Arms width apart,
trading items with easy rotation

Acting as one mass,
but avoiding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anti-Politics_Machine">anti-politics</a>,
a fine line separates us

&mdash;

As an advanced subset of statistical math becomes known as the god, Artificial Intelligence, to the business elite, casual commerce loses ground to efficiency experts that sort us harder than we can stand.

In a recent article, <a href="http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/provocations/neophobic-conservative-ai-overlords-want-everything-stay/">Cory Doctorow elucidates the stakes of this extreme removal of human oversight</a>.
